# Restaurant-Review-Sentiment-Analysis
This project implements a machine learning model for sentiment analysis on restaurant reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Key features include:
1.Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and preprocessed text data from restaurant reviews using NLTK and removed stopwords to prepare for analysis.
2.Feature Extraction: Utilized TF-IDF vectorization to convert text data into numerical features suitable for machine learning models.
3.Machine Learning Model: Trained a RandomForestClassifier to classify reviews as positive or negative based on the TF-IDF features.
4.Web Application: Developed a user-friendly web interface using Streamlit where users can input restaurant reviews and receive real-time sentiment predictions.
5.Evaluation Metrics: Implemented model evaluation metrics such as accuracy score and confusion matrix to assess model performance.
6.Technologies Used: Python, Pandas, NLTK, Scikit-learn for data processing and machine learning, Streamlit for web application development.

This project demonstrates proficiency in NLP, machine learning model development, and web application deployment. It serves as a practical example of applying data science techniques to analyze and classify sentiment in text data.
